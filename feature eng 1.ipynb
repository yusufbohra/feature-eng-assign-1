       "\"The Filter method in feature selection is a technique used in machine learning and statistics to select a subset of relevant features (variables) from a larger set of input features.

While it doesn't perform strict feature selection like LASSO, it can still effectively reduce the impact of less relevant features.\\n\\n3. **Elastic Net**:\\n   Elastic Net is a combination of LASSO and Ridge Regression.
